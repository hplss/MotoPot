# MotoPot
This is the repository for the Motorized Potentiometer project (by Andrew Ward).

This was a simple project that was comissioned by my father on his behalf during his tenure at Garder Denver International. It essentially serves as a controller platform for a number of motorized potentiometers. The embedded processor was an Arduino Nano compatible (Atmel 328p).

A demonstration of this project is shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHDDO3CcyW8">Here</a>
